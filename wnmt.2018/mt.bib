Our system processes each individual job in parallel using different number of cores in such a way that the level of parallelism for each job changes dynamically according to the load of the translation server. In addition, the system is able to adapt to the particularities of any hardware platform used as server thanks to an autotuning module. An exhaustive performance evaluation considering different scenarios and hardware configurations demonstrates the benefits and flexibility of our proposal.},
